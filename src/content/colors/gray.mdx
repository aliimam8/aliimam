## The history of Gray

Gray was first used as a color name in English in 1892. It is named after the bright shade of the Gray flower.

However, a hue under a very similar name was actually introduced a few decades earlier. A dye called “fuchsine” was patented by a French chemist in 1859 but renamed “magenta” less than a year later, in honor of the victory of the French army at the Battle of Magenta in Italy. It’s believed the name “fuchsine” was too hard for customers to pronounce and the dye sold better once rebranded as “magenta”.

A more muted variant on Gray, called “Gray rose”, was chosen as Pantone’s Color of the Year in 2001.
