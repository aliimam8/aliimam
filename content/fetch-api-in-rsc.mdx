No, this is not the right way to fetch data in server components. In short, do _not_ fetch your own API routes or route handlers (from now on, just "route handlers") in server components, instead just call the server-side logic directly. Imagine server components not as normal React components, but as the good old `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`. Instead of the code above, you should do something like this:

```tsx
import { prisma } from "~/lib/prisma";

export default async function Page() {
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: 123456 } });
  return <div>{user?.name}</div>;
}
```

**If you find yourself having to fetch from `localhost:3000` in your own Next.js app** (assuming this Next.js app runs on port 3000) **and the fetch requires an absolute URL, you are very likely doing something wrong**.

If you worry about authentication or similar stuff, [`cookies`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) and [`headers`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers) are helpful.

Route handlers should be instead used for client-side fetching, interactions with other services/applications, etc. If you find yourself repeating code in both the server component and the route handler, you can extract the common code into a separate utility function (say, `getUser(id: number): User | null`) and import it in both places.

Of course, this only applies to server components. In client components, you can fetch your own route handlers normally with `swr` or `react-query` (see also <Question id="when-client-component-in-app-router" />). That being said, we recommend you to use [server actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/forms-and-mutations) for mutations, because it integrates very nicely with the React router used by the `app` directory.

Now read on to see why `fetch`-ing route handlers in server components is a bad idea.

## Why does it require absolute URLs?

`fetch` in client-side does not require absolute URLs, because the browser knows the URL of the current page and hence can understand what host/domain to use. But, in server components, the fetch is run on the server, which is like running a `fetch` from a Node.js script inside your own computer. It doesn't know what host/domain to use (you don't know the domain of your computer do you?), so you have to specify it explicitly.

## Why does it not work during build? Why does it work in dev mode?

It requires the server to be running at (in the example above) `localhost:3000`. That is fulfilled during development mode and during runtime (`next start`), so the fetch works fine there. But during build, the server is not running, so the fetch fails.

## Why does the documentation describe `fetch` inside server components then? For what?

For communicating with a separate backend service (`api.yourapp.com`) or a third-party API (`api.thirdparty.com`).

## What are the drawbacks of the approach?

The most evident drawback of the approach is that it doesn't work (see above). But what if it _did_ work, or what if you only use it in the limited scenarios where it does work? What are the drawbacks then?

- **The fetch does not have access to headers and cookies automatically.** You need to manually extract the relevant informations with `headers` and `cookies` and pass them to the `fetch` call.

- **It is not type-safe.** In the examples above, if you use `fetch`, since the server component knows nothing about what would be responded by the route handler, the type has to be `any` and you have to manually type-check/validate the response. But if you use something like Prisma with server components directly as above, the type is available automatically (so you know if something can be `null` or you didn't typo `user.name` to `user.nmae`).

- **If you self-host, it is slower, albeit only _very very_ slightly.** It is essentially your server fetching data from itself, while pretending itself as a separate server. The overhead added by that pretense is small but it is there.

- **If you host the Next.js app on Vercel or a similar serverless platform, chances are it can be significantly slower.** At least for Vercel's case, your route handlers and dynamic server components are deployed to AWS Lambda, which can require a cold start if the lambda is not used for a while. We don't know how Vercel bundles the route handlers and server components to different lambdas, but if your route handler happens to need a cold start when you request the server component, you are taking that cold start penalty that could've been avoided if you didn't use a route handler in the first place.

- **It brings zero benefits.** Server components are run exclusively on the server anyway, you need not worry about server-side logic/variables leaking to the browser.

- You would be shooting yourself and other future maintainers in the foot. That is generally a bad idea.
